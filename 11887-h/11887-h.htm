        <h3>BIRTHPLACE OF THE EARL OF ELDON.</h3>
    </div>

    <p>Little need be said, by way of explanation, for the addition
    of the present subject to our collection of the birthplaces of
    eminent men. It is something to know that John Scott was born
    at Newcastle-upon-Tyne, in the principal dwelling represented
    in the above Engraving, in the year 1751; that he received the
    rudiments of his education at the free grammar-school of the
    town; that he grew up "a man of safe discretion;" that he
    enjoyed the highest legal honours which his sovereign could
    bestow for a quarter of a century; and that he still lives, a
    venerable octogenarian, in the enjoyment of "glory from his
    conscience, and honour from men." The biography of so
    distinguished an individual must have innumerable good
    tendencies: it at once inculcates the wholesome truth that
    "every man is the architect of his own fortune;" and it
    presents us, moreover, with the encouraging picture of a
    well-regulated life, and its healthful energies so employed in
    the discharge of important duties as to entitle the subject to
    high rank among the worthies of his country.</p>

    <p>John Scott, Lord Eldon, is the third son of William Scott,
    of Newcastle-upon-Tyne. "His father was by trade what in the
    language of the place is called a 'fitter,' or agent for the
    sale and shipment of coals. He had by industry and habits of
    close saving accumulated rather considerable means from small
    beginnings. Beyond this he was a man of great shrewdness and
    knowledge of the world," and quickly perceiving the talents of
    the two younger boys, William (now Lord Stowell,) and John, he
    wisely gave them an education in accordance with their mental
    endowments. "It is said that the singular variety in the talent
    of these two remarkable youths was manifested at a very early
    age. When asked to 'give an account of the sermon,' which was a
    constant Sabbath custom of their father, William, the eldest,
    gave at once a condensed and lucid digest of the general
    argument. John, on the other hand, would go into all the
    minutiae, but failed in producing the lucid, general view
    embodied in half the number of words by his
    brother."<a id="footnotetag1"
       name="footnotetag1"></a><a href="#footnote1"><sup>1</sup></a>
       The two boys received their early education at the free
       grammar-school of Newcastle.<a id="footnotetag2"
       name="footnotetag2"></a><a href="#footnote2"><sup>2</sup></a>
       William was from the beginning destined for the study of the
       law. John was at first intended for the church,
       <span class="pagenum"><a name="page194"
       id="page194"></a>[pg 194]</span> and was, accordingly, sent
       to Oxford: early marriage was, however, the fortunate means
       of changing his destination, and he began the world in the
       same profession with his brother. In 1757, John was entered
       as a student at the Middle Temple, and was called to the bar
       at the usual period. He at this time possessed an extensive
       stock of legal information, having been an indefatigable
       reader, and spent the two last years of his preliminary
       studies in the office of a special pleader. At his outset he
       made no progress, his powers being palsied by an oppressive
       diffidence. He therefore devoted his talents entirely to
       being a draftsman in Chancery. His employment was laborious,
       and not lucrative, while it materially injured his health.
       In a fit of despondency he resolved to retire into humble
       practice in his native county; and he had actually given up
       his chambers and taken leave of his friends in the
       metropolis, when he was not only diverted from his purpose
       by an eminent solicitor, but was even prevailed upon to make
       one more trial at the bar. His first success was the
       undoubted fruit of his extraordinary abilities, and is said
       to have originated in the sudden illness of a leading
       counsel the night before the trial of a complicated civil
       cause. It could not be put off, and the client of the lost
       leader was in despair, when Scott courageously took the
       brief, made himself in one night master of its voluminous
       intricacies, and triumphed. From this time he gained
       confidence, and his forensic reputation soon became
       established. He was much aided by the encouragement which he
       received from Lord Thurlow, who praised his abilities, and
       is said to have offered him a mastership in Chancery, which
       Mr. Scott declined.</p>

    <p>In 1783; Mr. Scott obtained a silk gown; and, through Lord
    Weymouth's interest, he was introduced into parliament for the
    borough of Weobly. It is stated that on the latter occasion, he
    stipulated for the liberty of voting as he pleased. He took a
    decided part with the Pitt administration; and in 1788, he was
    appointed solicitor-general, and knighted; in 1793, he rose to
    be attorney-general, and in the following year he conducted the
    trial of Hardy, Tooke, and Thelwall, for treason. Erskine was
    opposed to him; and the prosecution failed, though the speech
    of the attorney-general occupied nine hours in the
    delivery.</p>

    <p>In 1799, Sir John Scott was appointed to the chief
    justiceship of the Common Pleas, on the resignation of Chief
    Justice Eyre; and in the same year he was raised to the peerage
    by the title of Baron Eldon. In 1801, he was made Lord
    Chancellor, which high office he retained till the year 1827,
    with the exception of the short period during which the Whigs
    were in office, in 1806. His lordship was raised to the dignity
    of an earl at the coronation of George IV. in 1821.</p>

    <p>The high character of the Earl of Eldon as Chancellor is
    thus lucidly drawn by Sir Egerton Brydges: "Of all who, in the
    long lapse of ages, have filled the sacred seat on which he now
    (1823) sits, none ever had purer hands, none ever had a
    conscientious desire of equity more ardent and more incessant
    than Lord Eldon. The amazing expanse of his views, the
    inexpressible niceness of his discrimination, his unrelaxing
    anxiety to do justice in every individual case, the kindness of
    his heart, and the ductility of his ideas, all ensure that
    attention to every suitor which must necessarily obtain the
    unbounded admiration and attachment of the virtuous and the
    wise. Lord Eldon's eloquence," continues Sir Egerton, "is
    rather adapted to cultivated and thinking minds than to a
    popular audience. It generally addresses the understanding
    rather than the fancy. It frequently wants fluency, but
    occasionally is tinged with a high degree of moral pathos."</p>

    <p>We could illustrate the conscientious character alluded to
    by the above writer, with anecdotes of the chancellorship of
    Lord Eldon. As the following have, we believe, but once
    appeared in print, they may not, be familiar to the reader. Sir
    Richard Phillips relates:<a id="footnotetag3"
       name="footnotetag3"></a><a href="#footnote3"><sup>3</sup></a>
       "In conversation with Mr. Butterman, (at Dronfield), I heard
       two anecdotes of Lord Eldon, which, as an example to Lord
       Chancellors, and to public spirited parishioners, I consider
       it my duty to introduce. The incumbent, some years ago,
       thought proper to propose an exchange with an incompetent
       clergyman; when Mr. B., as a friend to the church, and some
       of his respectable neighbours took alarm at the negotiation,
       and in the commencement he penned a letter to the
       Chancellor. The other parties calculated on the arrangement,
       but, on applying to the Chancellor he could consent to no
       exchange, but that if the parties were tired of their
       positions, they might respectively resign, and there were
       plenty of candidates. The determination was final, and the
       scheme of exchange was abandoned. In another instance, a
       master had been regularly appointed to the grammar school at
       Dronfield, on liberal principles of education, but, within a
       few years, some prejudice was excited against him, and the
       churchwardens for the time thought proper to stop his
       salary. On this occasion, Mr. B. and some friends combined
       in an application to Lord Eldon, and his lordship instantly
       directed the churchwardens to render an account of the trust
       within a few days. They claimed time, and were allowed a
       month, when, without other form, he directed the salary to
       be paid to the appointed master, with all expenses."</p>

    <p>Newcastle contains memorials of Lord Eldon which indicate
    that the inhabitants <span class="pagenum"><a name="page195"
       id="page195"></a>[pg 195]</span> are proud of their
       distinguished fellow-freeman. A spacious range of elegant
       buildings is called Eldon Square: and in the Guildhall is a
       portrait of his lordship, opposite that of his brother, Lord
       Stowell.</p>

    <h3>RELIGIOUS FASTINGS.</h3>

    <p>From the remotest ages of antiquity most nations have
    practised fasting to keep the wrath of God from falling upon
    them for their sins. Some celebrated authors even affirm that
    fasting was originated by Adam after he had eaten of the
    forbidden fruit; but this obviously is carrying their
    arguments, in favour of fasting, too far, though it is as
    certain that the Jewish churches practised it from their first
    formation. The Egyptians, Phoenicians, and the Assyrians held
    the "solemn fast" in high favour. The Egyptians, according to
    Herodotus, before they offered in sacrifice the cow to Isis, to
    purify themselves from impurities, fasted and prayed. This
    custom he also ascribes to the Cyrenian women. Porphyry relates
    that the fasts of the Egyptians were sometimes continued for
    six weeks, and that the shortest ordained by their priests was
    seven days, during which they abstained from nearly all kinds
    of food. These rites they communicated to the Greeks, who
    observed these fasts more strictly, and with more outward show
    and solemnity. The Athenians likewise observed stated fasts,
    two of which were named "the Elusinian and Thesmoporian fasts;"
    the observation of these fasts was extremely rigid, especially
    amongst women, who, in mournful dresses, spent one whole day
    sitting on the ground (their sign of grief,) without taking the
    least food. The islanders of Crete, before sacrificing to
    Jupiter, had to abstain from food. A celebrated ancient author
    informs us, that those who wished to be initiated into the
    secrets of Cybele, fasted ten days before their initiation; and
    that, in short, the priests who gave the oracles, and those who
    came to consult them, had to perform this duty.</p>

    <p>Amongst other Heathen nations, before they prepared for any
    important enterprise, the whole expedition fasted. The
    Lacedemonians having agreed to aid an ally, ordained a fast
    throughout their nation, and without <i>even</i> excepting
    their <i>domestic animals</i>. The Romans having besieged the
    city of Tarentum, and the city being hard pressed, the citizens
    demanded succour of their friends, the inhabitants of Rhegium;
    who, preparatory to granting assistance to the besieged,
    commanded that a fast should be held throughout their
    territories. Their aid having proved successful, the government
    of Tarentum to commemorate this important event, ordained a
    perpetual fast on the day of their deliverance.</p>

    <p>Philosophers and certain religious people have for ages
    reckoned fasting as a service which led to important results,
    and a duty which could not be dispensed with without causing
    the wrath of God to fall upon the heads of the nation. At Rome
    it was practised even by the emperors. Amongst the most
    remarkable for keeping this institution were Numa Pompilius,
    Julius Caesar, Vespasian, &amp;c. Julian, the apostate, was so
    exact in the performance of this ordinance, that the fasting of
    the philosophers and of the priests themselves, was as nothing
    compared with his abstinence. Pythagoras fasted sometimes as
    long as forty days; his disciples followed the example of their
    master; and after his death they kept a continual fast, in
    which they denounced the inhabitants of the deep as well as the
    creatures of the meadow. The eastern Brahmins are remarkable
    for their fasting; but as the people believe they regale
    themselves with the good things of this life, in secret, their
    example gains not many followers. That nation which reckons
    itself infinitely superior to <i>us</i> "poor barbarians," the
    Chinese, also observe stated seasons of fasting and prayer. The
    Mahomedans likewise strictly observe fasting and prayer, and
    the exactness with which the dervishes perform them, and the
    lengths of time of their fasts are very
    remarkable.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page196"
       id="page196"></a>[pg 196]</span>

    <p>The Israelites were commanded by Jehovah himself to fast on
    the appearance of any plague, famine, war, &amp;c.; and though
    they sadly neglected the commands of God in other particulars,
    yet they obeyed this command with great devotedness. The
    abstinence of the ancient Jews generally lasted from twenty-six
    to twenty-seven hours. On these days they wore sackcloth, laid
    themselves in ashes, and sprinkled them on their heads, in
    token of their great grief and penitence. Some spent the whole
    night in the synagogue; occasionally using with great effect a
    scourge as a penance for their sins, or as a stimulant to
    devout behaviour. We think it is not improbable that it is from
    the Jews that the Roman Catholics derived their scourging
    penance system.</p>

    <p>In "happy smiling England," fasting was, and is, practised
    by the Catholics every Friday; it was also practised by the
    fathers of the church, and the primitive Protestants, at stated
    seasons. The custom is still observed amongst the methodists,
    who follow the example of their great leader, Wesley. The rust
    of time has, however, worn away the veneration for this "good
    <i>old</i> system," and it is totally disused by the general
    body of Protestants, except on great national occasions.</p>

    <p>The following particulars relating to the office of Sheriff,
    are derived from a manuscript copy of the <i>Journal</i> of
    Richard Hoare, Esq. during the year of his Shrievalty, in
    1740-41, in his own hand-writing, which is now in the
    possession of his grandson, Sir Richard Colt Hoare, Bart., of
    Stourhead, in Wiltshire. The above year became memorable in the
    city annals, from their having been <i>three</i> Lord Mayors
    during its progress, viz. Sir John Salter, knight; Humphry
    Parsons, Esq., and Daniel Lambert, Esq.</p>

    <p>Mr. Hoare, who was a banker, in Fleet Street, and principal
    of the respectable house which, instituted by one of his
    predecessors, still bears the family name, was elected alderman
    of the Ward of Farringdon Without, on St. George's day, 1740,
    in the place of Sir Francis Child, who died on the preceding
    Sunday, April the 20th. This honour was conferred upon him,
    whilst he was at Bath, and quite unexpectedly; and equally so,
    was his election to the Sheriffdom, conjointly with Mr.
    Alderman Marshall, on the midsummer-day following. Shortly
    afterwards they gave bonds under the penalty of 1,000<i>l</i>.
    to undertake and enter upon the office on the ensuing
    Michaelmas eve; and "thereupon, became each entitled to
    100<i>l</i>. out of the forfeitures of those, who had this year
    been nominated to be sheriff's by my Lord Mayor, but had paid
    their fines to be excused."</p>

    <p>In the intermediate time they prepared for the due execution
    of their duties, chose their under-sheriff's, &amp;c.; and, "as
    it is customary for each sheriff to preside over the two
    Counters separately, my brother Marshall chose that in the
    Poultry, and the care of Wood-street Counter was under my
    direction, and we agreed, at our joint expense, to give the
    usual livery gowns to the officers of both, although they are
    greater in number at the Poultry than in mine; in recompense
    for which, it was settled that we should equally share in the
    sale of the places upon any vacancy."</p>

    <p>On Sunday, the 28th of September, the sheriffs elect met at
    ten o'clock in the morning, at Drapers' Hall, "and there
    entertained several of the Court of Aldermen, and sixteen of
    the Court of Assistance of each of the Companies, viz: the
    Goldsmiths and the Drapers, with the usual breakfast of roast
    beef, burnt wine," &amp;c. He continues,&mdash;</p>

    <p>"Upon notice sent to us, that the Lord Mayor, with George
    Heathcote, and Sir John Lequesne, aldermen and sheriffs for the
    last year were attending at the council chamber, Guildhall, we
    all repaired thither; the gentlemen of the Court of Assistance
    walking two by two, the senior sheriff's company on the right
    hand, the aldermen following in their coaches; in which, we,
    though sheriffs-elect, took our rank as aldermen. Upon coming
    up to the area of Guildhall, the two companies made a lane for
    the aldermen to pass through, and after having waited on my
    Lord Mayor to Guildhall Chapel, to hear divine service, we
    returned back to the court of the hustings, which being opened
    by the common cryer, we were summoned to come forth and take
    the oath of office; which we accordingly did, together with the
    oaths of allegiance and abjuration; and the same was also
    administered to Mr. Tims, (clerk to St. Bartholomews,) as
    under-sheriff, he kneeling all the while.</p>

    <p>"When this was over, the gold chains were taken off from the
    former sheriffs, and put on us; and then the court being
    dissolved, the Lord Mayor went home, attended by the former
    sheriffs, and we returned back to Drapers' Hall to our dinner,
    provided for the Court of Aldermen and Courts of Assistance, at
    which the senior alderman took the chair as president, and the
    rest of the aldermen and gentlemen of Guildhall took their
    places at the upper table, whilst we, the sheriffs, sat at the
    head of the second table, with the gentlemen of the Courts of
    Assistance of our <span class="pagenum"><a name="page197"
       id="page197"></a>[pg 197]</span> two companies. When dinner
       was over, and the healths of the royal family were drunk,
       the cryer proclaimed the health and prosperity to the two
       sheriffs' companies in the following manner; that is to say,
       'Prosperity to the worshipful Company of Drapers, and
       prosperity to the worshipful Company of Goldsmiths: to the
       Goldsmiths and Drapers, and Drapers and Goldsmiths,
       prosperity to both:' and this is so usually done, naming
       each company first alternately, to prevent any dispute
       concerning preference or priority.</p>

    <p>"After dinner, we all retired to one table in the inner
    room, at which we, though sheriffs, were placed underneath all
    the aldermen; for whatever rank an alderman may be in point of
    seniority, yet during the year he serves as sheriff, he is to
    give place, and follow the rest of his brethren, both at the
    court, and all processions and entertainments. About six
    o'clock, the late sheriffs, having left the Lord Mayor at his
    house, attended us to Guildhall, where we were met by our own
    and the former under-sheriffs, together with the secondaries
    and keepers of the prisons; and the names of the respective
    prisoners in each gaol being read over, the keepers
    acknowledged them one by one, to be in their custody; and then
    tendered us the keys, which we delivered back to them again,
    and after having executed the indentures, whereby we covenanted
    and undertook the charge of our office, we were invited
    according to custom, to an adjoining tavern; and there partook
    of an entertainment of sack and walnuts, provided by the
    aforesaid keepers of the prisons.</p>

    <p>"Monday, September 29th. This being Michaelmas-day, my
    brother sheriff and I set out for the first time in our new
    equipages and scarlet gowns, attended by our beadles, and the
    several officers of our Counters, and waited on the Lord Mayor,
    at Merchant Taylors' Hall, at which he kept his mayoralty, and
    proceeded with him from thence, as is customary, to Guildhall,
    where the livery-men of the city were summoned to attend at the
    Court of Hustings for the election of a new lord mayor for the
    year ensuing. The recorder made a speech to the livery-men,
    'apprising them of the custom and manner of choosing a lord
    mayor; which, he observed, was for the Common Hall to nominate
    two of the aldermen who had served sheriffs, to the Court of
    Aldermen, who had then a right to elect either of them into
    that great office, and which ever that the court so fixed on,
    the Common Hall was bound to accept.' When he had ended, the
    Lord Mayor and Court of Aldermen retired into the Council
    Chamber, and left us to preside at the election, attended by
    the Common Sergeant and other officers. The method of voting
    is, by each alderman going up to the recorder and town clerk,
    who sit at a separate part of the room, and telling the person
    he would choose, a scratch is made under each respective
    name."</p>

    <p>On the day following, the two sheriffs again went to
    Guildhall, with the same company as on the preceding day, and
    waiting on the Lord Mayor in the Council Chamber, requested
    that his lordship and the recorder would present them at his
    Majesty's Court of Exchequer. Each sheriff then paid the usual
    fees, viz. <i>6l. 13s. 4d.</i> to the Lord Mayor, and <i>3l.
    6s. 8d.</i> to the recorder; after which, they proceeded to the
    Three Cranes' Stairs, in Upper Thames Street, "the Lord Mayor
    first; we, the sheriffs, next; the recorder and aldermen
    following in coaches, the companies walking before us.</p>

    <p>"From thence we went to Westminster in the city barge,
    taking place of all the aldermen: and our two companies
    attended in the Goldsmiths' barge, as before agreed on, adorned
    with half the colours, and rowed with half the watermen
    belonging to the Drapers' company. On landing, the companies
    went first, the Lord Mayor next, then the recorder with a
    sheriff on each side, and last the aldermen. On our approaching
    the bar of the Exchequer [in Westminster Hall,] the recorder,
    in a speech, presented us to the Court, one of the Barons being
    seated there for that purpose, signifying the choice the
    citizens had made, and that, in pursuance of our charter, we
    were presented to his Majesty's justices for his royal
    approbation; and the Baron accordingly approving the choice,
    he, and the Clerks of the Exchequer, were invited to our
    dinner; then the late sheriffs were sworn to their accounts,
    and made their proffers; and the senior alderman present cut
    one twig in two, and bent another, and the officers of the
    court counted six horse-shoes and hob-nails.</p>

    <p>"This formality, it is said, is passed through each year, by
    way of suit and service for the citizens holding some tenements
    in St. Clement's Danes, as also some other lands; but where
    they are situated no one knows, nor doth the city receive any
    rents or profits thereby.</p>

    <p>"This done, we returned in the same order to the Three
    Cranes, and from thence, in our coaches, to dinner at Drapers'
    Hall; where my Lord Mayor, aldermen, gentlemen of Guildhall,
    and guests invited, dined at one table, and we, the sheriff's,
    at the head of another, with the Court of Assistance of each of
    our companies: and the Clerks of the Exchequer by themselves at
    another table. After dinner, the Lord Mayor, aldermen, &amp;c.
    returned into a separate room, where we sat with them at the
    head of the table, one on each side of the Lord Mayor; our two
    companies were in another room, and the greatest part of the
    Clerks of the Exchequer remained in the hall."</p>

    <p>On the 7th of October they "settled a
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page198"
       id="page198"></a>[pg 198]</span> point," with the keeper of
       Newgate in regard to the transportation of <i>felons</i>.
       That was, that the keeper should deliver them to the
       merchant, "who contracts to carry them over," at the door of
       Newgate, and there discharge himself of any further custody;
       but leaving him and his officers the privilege of protecting
       them down to the water side, according to any private
       agreement between him and the merchant; it being fully
       understood that the sheriffs should not be responsible for
       their charge "from the time of their first delivery."</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>(<i>From Mr. Alexander Gordon's Treatise on Elemental
        Locomotion. Concluded from page 185.</i>)</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>We do not advocate any thing so preposterous as the change
    of the whole animate power of Great Britain into inanimate,
    though in this the political economist can see the solution of
    all our Malthusian difficulties to an indefinite extent and
    duration. What we urge is merely the partial adoption of the
    thing to such an extent as will relax the present pressure, and
    restore us to a wholesome state of national prosperity. This
    will occasion no dangerous experiment, and will be gradually
    followed up by a progressive conversion, by which all the
    conflicting interests of society will be neutralized, and the
    aggregate wealth, and prosperity, and happiness of the empire
    be equalized.</p>

    <p>If then <i>elemental locomotion</i> can he made to
    substitute the expensive, unproductive system of animate labour
    now in use, it will indubitably be for the vital interest of
    all classes of society that the substitution should be realized
    speedily and extensively. That steam can be so applied has been
    <i>satisfactorily proved</i>. The report of the Committee of
    the House of Commons establishes this. But the evidence of
    several of the enlightened and practical witnesses who were
    examined before that committee bears with too much emphasis
    upon the detail of the commercial and economic advantages of
    the project we have just been attempting to enumerate and
    advocate, for us not to avail ourselves of it even at this
    early stage of our work. It being quite decisive in support of
    the grand conclusion to which the said committee came after
    three months of patient and thorough investigation of the
    subject, viz. "<i>That the substitution of inanimate for
    animate power is one of the most important improvements in the
    means of internal communication ever introduced.</i>"</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[Then follow extracts from the evidence of Messrs.
        Torrens, John Farey, Davies Gilbert, and Goldsworthy
        Garney.]</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>In viewing the moral advantages which must result from
    steam-carriages, we find them of no less importance. There are
    but few so constitutionally indifferent to acceleration in
    travelling as the Hollander, who delighted in the "old, solemn,
    straight-forward, regular Dutch canal speed&mdash;three miles
    an hour for expresses, and two for joy or trot journeys."
    Acceleration in the speed of travelling, if unaccompanied by
    danger, is eagerly sought after, because the period of
    discomfort is lessened. But steam-carriages will not only
    lessen the discomfort by shortening its duration; they can be
    so equipped that positive comfort, nay, luxury, may be enjoyed.
    A steam-engine is perfectly under control, and consequently
    much more safe than horses. The life of the traveller cannot be
    jeoparded by the breaking of a rein, horses being frightened,
    running off, &amp;c. &amp;c.; the steamer, it will be seen, the
    honourable Committee report to the House "is perfectly safe for
    passengers."</p>

    <p>The actual casualties of stage-coaches, however, we may
    observe, bear no proportion to the loss of lives from
    consumption and other diseases occasioned by cold and wet, from
    exposure on the top of coaches.<a id="footnotetag4"
       name="footnotetag4"></a><a href="#footnote4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>

    <p>Let us consider also how far humanity is outraged by the
    present system of quick travelling. The short average life of
    stage-coach horses (three years only!) shows how dreadfully
    over-wrought and <i>out-wrought</i> they are by the great speed
    now in practice. Driven for eight or ten miles, with an
    oppressive weight, they tremble in every nerve. With nostrils
    distended, and sides moving in breathless agony, they can
    scarce, when unyoked, crawl to the stable. 'Tis true they are
    well fed; the interest of their owners secures that. They are
    over-well fed, in order that a supernatural energy may be
    exerted. The morrow comes when their galled withers are again
    to be wrung by the ill-cushioned collars, and the lumbering of
    the wheels. But we do not witness all the misery of the noble
    and the generous steed. When the shades of night impend, the
    reproaches of the feeling, or the expostulations of the timid
    traveller no longer protect him from the lash; and the dread of
    Mr. Martin's act ceases to effect for a time its beneficent
    purpose; when the stiffened joints&mdash;the cracked
    hoofs&mdash;the greasy legs&mdash;and stumbling gait of the
    worn-out animal are all put into agonized motion by belabouring
    <i>him upon the raw</i>! The expression is Hibernian, but the
    brutality is our own. A few ill-gained pounds reconcile the
    enormity to the owner&mdash;and the cheapness and expedition of
    the conveyance give it public sanction: but humanity is
    outraged by the same: human sympathies are seared; and the
    noble <span class="pagenum"><a name="page199"
       id="page199"></a>[pg 199]</span> precept, that "the merciful
       man is merciful to his beast," is trampled under foot.</p>

    <p>Thus then, by substituting elementary for physical power, we
    have comfort for comparative inconvenience&mdash;the inside of
    an elegant apartment, where books, amusement, or general
    conversation may occupy agreeably the time&mdash;for the
    outside of a hard, unsafe stage conveyance, and exposure to all
    changes or varieties of atmosphere. Nay, we see no reason to
    prevent such improvement in steam-carriages as shall fit them
    up like steam-boats, the campaigning carriage of Napoleon, or
    the travelling long coach of the present Duke of Orleans, with
    beds, and a furnished table. We have besides safety for
    danger&mdash;accelerated speed without inhumanity&mdash;gain of
    time&mdash;of accommodation&mdash;of money&mdash;and over and
    above all, as a non-consumer of food, we have by the
    substitution what will remove the host of Malthusian ills to a
    period of almost indefinite duration.</p>

    <h3>ZOOLOGICAL GARDENS, REGENT'S PARK.</h3>

    <p>We recommend such of our London friends and visiters from
    the country as have not lately passed an hour or two in the
    Zoological Gardens, to do so without further delay. The present
    season is warm and genial, and the rejoicing rays of the
    morning and noontide sun enliven the tenants of this mimic
    world in a garden. As evening approaches the air becomes chill
    and misty, though</p>

    <h3>THE VOICE OF HUMANITY.</h3>

    <p>"The Association for promoting Rational Humanity towards the
    Animal Creation" exists&mdash;though, in one sense, as a blot
    upon the character of the age. They publish the above Journal
    quarterly, assembling acts of atrocity which make the blood
    curdle in our veins, and remind us that "all are not men that
    wear the human form." The funds of the society are not in a
    prosperous condition; the sand of their philanthropy is well
    nigh run out, and fresh appeals are to be made. Let us glance
    at the contents of, the <i>Voice</i> before us. The subject
    "Abattoirs contrasted with Slaughter-houses and
    Smithfield-market," is continued&mdash;a plan which we
    illustrated in <i>The Mirror</i> about five years since. True
    enough the Society write, but the people do not consider; they
    are so wedded to old prejudices and habits, and the mammon of
    money, that pestilential slaughter-houses are tolerated in the
    midst of a "city of the plague," notwithstanding a law exists
    for its prevention. Four hospitals are building in the
    metropolis&mdash;and markets are increasing for the sale of the
    necessaries and luxuries of life; the <i>Haymarket</i> has been
    removed from a fashionable quarter to the suburbs, that loaded
    carts may not obstruct carriages in their road to St. James's,
    the Houses of Parliament, and the Opera&mdash;yet, not a
    single, <i>Abattoir</i>&mdash;for the health of the
    people&mdash;exists near the metropolis. The King and the Court
    patronize and plan horse-racing, throwing the lasso, and, if
    recent report be true, hawking; the Parliament legislate, a
    bill is "ordered to be printed"&mdash;yet, the inconsistency
    and tardiness of these proceedings compel us to ask, where is
    the truth of the motto&mdash;<i>Salus populi suprema lex</i>.
    Convictions before magistrates for acts of cruelty are not
    uncommon; yet, it is in this, as in many other laws, the poor
    are caught, while the rich break through the meshes of the net.
    In the work before us are recorded Mr. Osbaldeston's matches,
    including "the cold-blooded cruelty towards the generous and
    heart-broken <i>Rattler</i>, in riding him thirty-four miles in
    the space of 2 hours, 18 min., and 56 sec." Next are four
    police cases of cruelties towards horses, bullocks, and cats,
    the persons convicted being "of low estate." Yet there follows
    the fact of <i>a respectable woman</i> boiling a cat to death!
    and next is this quotation from the <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i>
    for April, 1789:&mdash;</p>

    <p>"Died, April 4, at Tottenham, John Ardesoif, Esq.; a young
    man of large fortune, and in the splendour of his carriages and
    horses rivalled by few country gentlemen. His table was that of
    hospitality, where it may be said he sacrificed too much to
    conviviality. Mr. Ardesoif was fond of cock-fighting, and he
    had a favourite cock upon which he had won many profitable
    matches. The last bet he made upon this cock he lost; which so
    enraged him, that he had the bird tied to a spit, and roasted
    alive before a large fire. The screams of the miserable animal
    were so affecting, that some gentlemen who were present
    attempted to interfere, which so exasperated Mr. Ardesoif, that
    he seized the poker; and, with the most furious vehemence,
    declared that he would kill the first man who interfered; but,
    in the midst of his passionate assertions, he fell down dead
    upon the spot!"</p>

    <p>If we be asked whether it be proper to regard <i>all</i>
    such dispensations as judicial inflictions, we reply in the
    words of Cowper above:</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"'Tis not for us, with rash surmise,</p>

            <p>To point the judgments of the skies,</p>

            <p class="i2">But judgments <i>plain as this</i>,</p>

            <p>That, sent for man's instruction, bring</p>

            <p>A written label on their wing,</p>

            <p class="i2">'Tis hard to read amiss."</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>[A contribution full of touching simplicity follows:]</p>

            <p class="i2">On that poor worm bestowed.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="stanza">

            <p class="i2">The life thou canst not give.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>Here we may remark, that much wanton cruelty has been
    abolished by the extended education of the people. Brutal
    sports among boys are much less indulged than formerly, and the
    worrying of domestic animals almost invariably denotes a <i>bad
    boy</i>, in the worst sense of the phrase, likely to make a bad
    man; "so true to nature is the admirable aphorism of
    Wordsworth:&mdash;</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>The boy's the father of the man."</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>But we do not so much complain of boyish as of adult
    cruelties; though, according to the above showing, such
    atrocities will be less rare in the next than in the present
    generation. To conclude, we hope that the present notice may
    awaken the sympathy of the reader towards the laudable objects
    of the <i>Society</i>, under whose guidance the <i>Voice of
    Humanity</i> is published. It is a difficult matter to point
    out "the uneducated," and writers of all grades are eternally
    babbling of our high state of civilization and refinement,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page202"
       id="page202"></a>[pg 202]</span> yet, we repeat, the
       necessity of this association is an anomaly which amounts to
       a national disgrace.</p>

    <h3>VISIT TO THE SUMMIT OF MOUNT ETNA.</h3>

    <h4><i>By Lieutenant G.H.P. White, Royal Navy.</i></h4>

    <p>On the evening of the 13th of July, 1830, I set off from
    Catania with a party of my messmates, to ascend Mount Etna,
    taking the necessary guides, and two sumpter mules to carry the
    provisions, &amp;c., as nothing in that way can be procured
    after leaving Nicolosi, which is a small village about twelve
    miles from Catania. Etna is divided by the Sicilians into three
    several regions. The first is called Pi&egrave; de Montagna,
    the second Nemerosa, and the third Discoperta. The ascent,
    though very gradual, commences immediately on leaving the city
    of Catania, over a tolerably constructed road; the country
    around is formed on an ancient volcanic soil; probably the
    third eruption mentioned by Thucydides, which happened in the
    sixth year of the Peloponnesian war, and the second of the
    eighty-eighth Olympiad. Traversing the lands of Battianti, and
    St. Giovanni della Punta, the road is constantly over the lava,
    and the country on either side is delicious. Trecastagne, nine
    miles from Catania, is seated on the acclivity of a high
    volcanic mountain. The scene here is beautiful and picturesque.
    Near the principal church the view is most extensive. Towards
    the east the mountains of Calabria, the sea stretching from
    Taormina to Catania, bathing the sides of Etna, covered with
    vineyards, woods and villages: northward rises the mountain
    itself, surrounded by its progeny of pigmy mountains; these
    have been thrown up in various forms, composed principally of
    cinders, and covered with rich vegetation. The freshness of the
    air, the beauty and picturesque situations of the houses
    surrounded by lofty and fine trees, the over-teeming fertility
    of the soil, and the laughing fields, where golden Ceres still
    lingers, unwilling to quit her favourite abode, intersected by
    courses of lava, as yet unproductive, make this view one of the
    most beautiful and interesting that can be imagined. These
    mighty streams of once liquid fire, extending in many places
    ten miles in length, by two or three in breadth, fill the mind
    with horror and astonishment: that such wondrous masses,
    consisting of earths, stones, and minerals, fused and mixed,
    could be driven forth in one wild current from the mountain,
    makes us pause, and confounds any attempt to reason on the
    phenomena.&mdash;And, although the lava for many centuries lays
    waste the superincumbent land, yet, after a certain, but very
    long period, it is brought by human industry into such a state
    as to become the richest soil for cultivation: but when we
    reflect on the necessity of some ages to effect this wished-for
    state of decomposition, we bewilder the mind without arriving
    at any certain conclusion. When this process is duly effected,
    the cactus opuntia, or prickly pear, is planted, which hastens
    the desired event, and has the power to break up the lava, and
    render it fit for productive purposes. Five miles from
    Trecastagne is Nicolosi, a small village which has often
    suffered from the fire-vomiting mountain. Here we supped, and
    baited the mules for two hours. Nicolosi, according to Signor
    Gemmellero, a Sicilian physician, long resident at Catania, is
    two thousand one hundred and twenty-eight feet above the level
    of the sea, and its mean temperature 64&deg; Fahr.</p>

    <p>From hence, to an almost interminable extent, there is a
    most superb view of the surrounding country; nothing can be
    more varied, grand, and sublime; every spot spared by the
    all-devastating lavas, is highly cultivated; the vines and
    other productive fruit-trees are seen laden with the most
    delicious fruits; the groves of olives, the towns and villages,
    in almost endless aerial perspective, all terminated by the
    distant and deep-blue sea, form a scene the most enchanting
    that can be conceived. We remounted about ten o'clock, P.M.,
    our trusty mules, and pursued or journey. The evening was
    deliciously serene, the stars shone with extraordinary
    brilliancy, and the sky appeared intensely blue, while the
    galaxy, or milky way, beamed like a splendid stream of light
    across the azure expanse.</p>

    <p>The cool breezes now wafted from the upper regions of the
    mountain were very refreshing, and exhilarated our spirits in
    an extraordinary degree. Passed Monte Rosso, which is about 600
    feet above the level of the surrounding plain, and is said to
    have been thrown up during the great eruption of the year 1669,
    and from which issued that horrible stream of burning lava,
    which, after destroying the country for the length of fourteen
    miles, ran into the sea at Catania.</p>

    <p>About six miles higher up commences the Nemerosa region,
    which, like a beautiful green girdle, encircles the mountain;
    it abounds with ancient hillocks, and lava of different
    periods, and is almost covered with frowning woods of oak,
    holm, beech and pines, on the more elevated points.</p>

    <p>After enjoying for some time this stupendous and enchanting
    treat, we kept torturing and progressing, lost in pleasing
    reveries caused by the fairy scene.</p>

    <p>Halted at the upper boundary of the forest region, to
    refresh our mules, and exchange our light clothing for garments
    of a warmer texture, as the wind now blew cool and somewhat
    chilly; for the temperature of this spot was about 50&deg;,
    while that of Catania, which
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page203"
       id="page203"></a>[pg 203]</span> we had only left a few
       hours ago, was about 84&deg; Fahr.</p>

    <p>The road, on leaving our resting-place, became tedious and
    cheerless; hardly any vegetation was discoverable, and still
    wilder regions appeared above us. The path now lay over masses
    of rough lava; so much so, that at times it became necessary to
    dismount and actually drag our jaded animals over the rugged
    precipices which obstructed our progress: the intricacy of the
    path required us to follow one another very closely, that we
    might not lose the track, which became so tortuous in its
    course, as would puzzle any one but a muleteer accustomed to
    the road to find the clue of this volcanic labyrinth in the
    darkness of night.</p>

    <p>After much anxious travelling over wastes of cinders and
    black sand, we seemed to be approaching near the wished-for
    summit; when, about two o'clock, A.M., the moon, now shorn of
    her beams, queen like, arose behind the bifurcated summit of
    Etna; her cheering light was very grateful to us in this wild
    spot. The awful cone of the mountain pillowed against the
    heavens, and emitting clouds of silvery white smoke from its
    burning crater, had a grand effect at this solemn hour of the
    night.</p>

    <p>At three o'clock, arrived at the Casa Inglese, a rude hut
    built by the English troops when stationed in Sicily, during
    the late war. Here it became again necessary to halt a little
    to put on some extra clothing. As soon as this was
    accomplished, the signal for the ascent was made by the guides
    giving each person of the party a long staff, to assist him in
    clambering the steeps, as the mules could not proceed any
    further, owing to the nature and fatigue of the ascent. The
    first portion of the road lay over large broken masses of lava,
    most wearisome to scramble over. On approaching nearer the
    apex, the path was over cinders, fine black sand, and scoria.
    In wading through this compound the ascent became so difficult
    and fatiguing, that we were all under the necessity of reposing
    every twenty or thirty yards, tormented by the sulphureous
    vapour, which rendered respiration painful, and was even less
    supportable than the abruptness of the mountain path!</p>

    <p>At length, after somewhat more than an hour's walk, the most
    harassing that can be imagined, we arrived at the top just as
    the day began to dawn. To paint the feelings at this dizzy
    height, requires the pen of poetic inspiration; or to describe
    the scene presented to mortal gaze, when thus looking down with
    fearful eye on the almost boundless prospect beneath! The blue
    expanded ocean, fields, woods, cities, rivers, mountains, and
    all the wonted charms of the terrestrial world, had a magic
    effect, when viewed by the help of the nascent light; while
    hard by yawned that dreadful crater of centuries untold,
    evolving thick sulphureous clouds of white smoke, which rolling
    down the mountain's side in terrific grandeur, at length formed
    one vast column for many miles in extent across the sky. Anon
    the mountain growled awfully in its inmost recesses, and the
    earth was slightly convulsed! We now attempted to descend a
    short distance within the crater; the guides, timid of its
    horrors, did not relish the undertaking, but were induced at
    length, and conducted the party behind some heaps of lava, from
    whence was a grand view of this awful cavern. The noise within
    the gulf resembled loud continuous thunderings, and after each
    successive explosion, there issued columns of white, and
    sometimes of black smoke.</p>

    <p>The crater presents the appearance of an inverted cone, the
    interior part of which is covered with crystallizations of
    salts and sulphur, of various brilliant hues&mdash;red appeared
    to predominate, or rather a deep orange colour. Writers vary
    much in their accounts as to the circumference of the crater.
    Captain Smyth, R.N., who had an opportunity to ascertain it
    correctly, describes it as an oval, stretching from E. and by
    N. to W., and by S. with a conjugate diameter of four hundred
    and ninety-three yards; the transverse he was prevented from
    ascertaining by a dense cloud that arose before his operations
    were completed. It was soon requisite for us to retire from
    this spot, as the smoke began to increase, and our guides said
    that some adventurous travellers had lost their lives by
    approaching too near, and were either blown into the abyss
    below by the violence of the wind, which is generally very
    strong at this elevation, or suffocated by a sudden burst of
    the sulphureous vapour.</p>

    <p>The Regione Deserta, or desolate region of Etna, first
    attracts the eye, marked in winter by a circle of ice and snow,
    but now (July) by cinders and black sand. In the midst the
    great crater rears its burning head, and the regions of intense
    heat and extreme cold shake hands together. The eye soon
    becomes satiated with its wildness, and turns with delight on
    the Sylvana region, which, with its magnificent zone of forest
    trees, embraces the mountain completely round: in many parts of
    this delightful tract are seen hills, now covered with the most
    luxuriant vegetation, that have been formed by different
    eruptions of Etna. This girdle is succeeded by another still
    richer, called the Regione Culta, abundant in every fruit or
    grain that man can desire: the small rivers Semetus and
    Alcantara intersect these fertile fields; beyond this the whole
    of Sicily, with its cities, towns, and villages, its
    corn-fields and vineyards in almost endless perspective, charm
    and delight the senses.</p>

    <p>The summit of the mountain is composed of scoria, and
    crystallizations of sulphur, with here and there heaps of lava;
    wherever a <span class="pagenum"><a name="page204"
       id="page204"></a>[pg 204]</span> stick is thrust in, the
       opening immediately emits a volume of white smoke, and if
       the hand be applied to the aperture, it is soon withdrawn on
       account of the great heat. The mean temperature of the
       summit, during the months of July and August, is 37&deg;
       Fahr. After having remained about an hour, descended to the
       Casa Inglese. After an hour's repose, proceeded downwards,
       visited the Philosopher's Tower, as it is called, which
       tradition says was constructed by Empedocles while he was
       studying the various phenomena of Etna.</p>

    <p>About a mile or two from this spot, there is a grand view of
    the Val di Bove. The foreground consists of lava, forming the
    face of an enormous precipice, at the bottom of which is seen a
    lovely valley, gradually sloping down towards the coast,
    embracing the three several regions of the mountain, to which
    the purple wave of the Mediterranean forms a noble boundary:
    nothing can be more varied, rich, and beautiful than this
    scene, as it comprises every object necessary to form a perfect
    landscape.</p>

    <p>It was interesting to notice the gradual increase of
    vegetation during the descent. The Senecio Christhenifolius
    grows at the elevation of 8,830 feet, the Juniperus Communis
    commences at 6,800. Then follow the Pinus Sylv., Betula Alba,
    Quercus Robur, and the Fagus Sylvaticus. The olive is seen at
    the altitude of 3,000 feet, and the vines flourish as high as
    5,000 feet.&mdash;<i>United Service Journal.</i></p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[In a clever paper on the geographical position and
        history of Active Volcanoes, contributed by W.M. Higgins,
        Esq. F.G.S. and J.W. Draper, Esq. to the <i>Magazine of
        Natural History</i>, is the following outline of Etna.]</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Etna is entirely composed of volcanic rocks, and rises in
    imposing grandeur to the height of 10,000 ft. above the level
    of the sea. It is about 180 miles in circumferences, and is
    surrounded on every hand by apparently small volcanic cones,
    though of no inconsiderable size, which tend in a great degree
    to increase the apparent dimensions of the central mountain.
    Some of these cones are covered with vegetation, but others are
    arid and bare. From this variety in the progress of vegetation,
    some persons have endeavoured to calculate the relative ages of
    the cones; but these opinions are exceedingly vague, as it
    requires a longer period to form a soil on some lavas than on
    others. The earliest historical notice we have of this mountain
    is by Thucydides, who states that there were three eruptions
    previous to the Peloponnesian war (431 B.C.), to one of which
    Pindar alludes in his first Pythian Ode. In the year 396 B.C.
    the volcano was again active; and according to Diodorus
    Siculus, the Carthaginian army was stopped in its march against
    Syracuse by the flowing lava. But let it suffice to say, that
    ten eruptions previous to, and forty-eight subsequent to, the
    Christian era, have been recorded; some when the mountain was
    in the phase of moderate activity, and others when in the phase
    of prolonged intermittence.</p>

    <h3>ROBIN HOOD.</h3>

    <blockquote>
        <p>(<i>Concluded from page 182</i>.)</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>With respect to the personal character of Robin Hood, it is
    generally agreed that he was active, brave, prudent, patient,
    possessed of uncommon bodily strength, and considerable
    military skill; just, generous, and beloved by his followers.
    As proofs of his singular popularity, his story and exploits
    have been made the subject of various dramatic exhibitions, as
    well of innumerable poems, lyrics, songs, and ballads; he has
    given rise to divers proverbs, and to swear by him was a common
    practice. Some writers say his songs have been preferred on
    solemn occasions, not only to the Psalms of David, but to the
    New Testament, and his service to the word of God. We have the
    opinion of Bishop Latimer on this head:&mdash;"I came," says
    the bishop (in his sixth sermon before King Edward VI.) "to a
    place, riding on a journey homeward from London, and I sent
    word over night into the town, that I would preach there in the
    morning, because it was a holyday, and methought it was a
    holydayes worke; the churche stode in my way, and I toke my
    horse and my companye and went thither. I thought I should have
    found a great companye in the churche, and when I came there,
    the churche dore was faste locked;
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page205"
       id="page205"></a>[pg 205]</span> I tarried halfe an houre
       and more, and at last the keye was founde, and one of the
       parishe commes to me, and sayes, 'Syr, thys ys a busye day
       with us, we cannot heare you; it is Robyn Hoode's day; the
       parishe is gone abroad to gather for Robyn Hoode.' I pray
       you let them not, I was fayne there to geve place to Robyn
       Hoode. I thought my rochet should have been regarded thoughe
       I were not; but it woulde not serve, it was fayne to give
       place to Robyn Hoode's men. It is no laughyng matter, my
       friendes, it is a wepynge matter, a heavy matter under a
       pretence for gatherynge for Robyn Hoode, a traytoure and a
       thefe, to put out a preacher, to have his office lesse
       esteemed, to prefer Robyn Hoode before the mynystration of
       God's word, and all thys hath come of unpreachynge prelates.
       Thys realme hath been il provided, for that it hath had
       suche corrupte judgementes in it, to prefer Robyn Hode to
       Godde's worde. Yf the bysshoppes had bene preachers, there
       sholde never have bene any such thynge," &amp;c.</p>

    <p>Robin Hood was believed to possess supernatural powers. In
    the parish of Halifax is an immense stone or rock, supposed to
    be a Druidical monument, there called Robin Hood's penny-stone,
    which he is said to have used to pitch with at a mark, for his
    amusement. There was likewise another of these stones of
    several tons weight, which the country people would say he
    threw off an adjoining hill with a spade, as he was digging. At
    Bitchover, where it was said he lived, among several groups of
    rocks, were some stones called Robin Hood's Stride, being two
    of the highest and most remarkable. He obtained also the
    distinction of sainthood, in having a festival allotted to him,
    and solemn games instituted in honour of his memory; a short
    account of which will be found in <i>The Mirror</i>, No. 544,
    p. 259. These games were celebrated till the latter end of the
    sixteenth century, not by the populace only, but by kings and
    princes, and grave magistrates, in Scotland and in England;
    being considered in the former country of the highest political
    importance, and essential to the civil and religious liberties
    of the people; the efforts of government to suppress them
    frequently producing tumult and insurrection.</p>

    <p>In Ray's Itineraries, 1760, we are told that Robin Hood's
    bow, one of his arrows, his chair, his cap, and one of his
    slippers, were preserved till within the above century. In
    Brome's Travels, is the following notice of his relics: "having
    pleased ourselves with the antiquities of Nottingham, we took
    horse and went to visit the well, and ancient chair, of Robin
    Hood, which is not far from hence, within the Forest of
    Sherwood. Being placed in the chair, we had a cap which they
    say was his, very formally put upon our heads, and having
    performed the usual ceremonies befitting so great a solemnity,
    we received the freedom of the chair, and were incorporated
    into the society of that renowned brotherhood." In Hutton's
    Journey from Birmingham to London, 1785, he states, "I was much
    pleased with a slipper, belonging to the famous Robin Hood,
    shown me, fifty years ago, at St. Ann's Well, near Nottingham,
    a place upon the borders of Sherwood Forest, to which he
    resorted." Over a spring called Robin Hood's Well, four miles
    north of Doncaster, is a handsome stone arch, erected by Lord
    Carlisle, where passengers from the coach used to drink of the
    fair water, and give alms to two people who attended.</p>

    <p>Thus, not only did those places retain his name which
    afforded him security or amusement, but even the well at which
    he quenched his thirst. There is also Robin Hood's Bay, on the
    coast of Yorkshire. It is mentioned by Leland as "a fischer
    tounlet of 20 bootes caulled Robyn Huddes Bay, a dok or bosom
    of a mile yn length:" in this bay he often went fishing in the
    summer season, and not far from this he had butts or marks set
    up, where he used to exercise his men in shooting with the long
    bow.</p>

    <p>After Robin's death, his company dispersed, and are supposed
    to have been distinguished from the name of their gallant
    leader, by the title of Roberdsmen. It may not be uninteresting
    to subjoin a short account of the last days of Robin's friend
    and favourite, Little John. The honour of his death and burial
    is contended by rival nations, first by England. At the village
    of Hathersage, about six miles from Castleton, in Derbyshire,
    is Little John's grave. Tradition states, some curious person
    caused it to be opened, when there were found several bones of
    uncommon size, which he preserved; but meeting afterwards with
    many unlucky accidents, he carefully replaced them, partly at
    the intercession of the sexton who had taken them up for him,
    and who had in like manner been visited with misfortunes, but
    upon restoring the bones all these troubles ceased. Secondly,
    by Scotland. In Murray-land, according to the historian, Hector
    Boece, is "the Kirke of Pette, quhare the banis of Lytill Johne
    remainis in grete admiratioun of pepill. He hes bene fourtene
    feet of hycht with square membris effering thairto VI zeris,"
    continues he, "afore the cumyng of this werk to lycht we saw
    his hanche-bane, als mekill as the hail bane of ane man, lor we
    schot our arme in the mouth thairof. Be quhilk apperis how
    strang and square pepill grew in our regioun afore they were
    effeminat with lust and intemperance of mouth." Thirdly, by
    Ireland. "There stood," as Stanihurst relates, "in Ostmantowne
    greene an hillocke, named Little John his shot. The occasion,"
    he says, proceeded of this&mdash;"In the yeere one thousand one
    hundred foure score and nine, there ranged three robbers
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page206"
       id="page206"></a>[pg 206]</span> and outlaws in England,
       among which Robert Hood and Little John weere cheefeteins,
       of all theeves doubtlesse the most courteous. Robert Hood
       being betrayed at a nunrie in Scotland, called Bricklies,
       the remnant of the crue was scattered, and everie man forced
       to shift for himselfe; whereupon Little John was faine to
       flee the realme by sailing to Ireland, where he sojornied
       for a few daies at Dublin. The citizens beeing doone to
       understand the wandering outcast to be an excellent archer,
       requested him hartilie to trie how far he could shoote at
       random; who yeelding to their behest, stood on the bridge of
       Dublin, and shot to that mole hill, leaving behind him a
       monument, rather by his posteritie to be woondered, than
       possiblie by anie man living to be counterscored. But as the
       repaire of so notorious a champion to anie countrie would
       soone be published, so his abode could not be long
       concealed, and therefore to eschew the danger of laws, he
       fled into Scotland, where he died at a town or village
       called Moravie." But, Mr. Walker, after observing, that
       "poor Little John's great practical skill in archery could
       not save him from an ignominious fall," says "it appeared
       from some records in the Southwell family, that he was
       publicly executed for robbery on Arbor-hill, Dublin."</p>

    <p>A bow, said to have belonged to Little John, with the name
    of Nayler upon it, is now in the possession of a gentleman in
    the West Riding of Yorkshire.<a id="footnotetag6"

    <blockquote>
        <p>[This is one of the <i>Naturo-Philosophical</i> volumes
        of the <i>Cabinet Cyclopaedia</i>, and is therefore to be
        viewed as a portion of that series rather than as a
        substantive work. Its preparation has been entrusted to Mr.
        M. Donovan, Professor of Chemistry to the Company of
        Apothecaries in Ireland; so that it comes to us with some
        share of recommendatory experience on the part of the

        advantages of Mr. Donovan's volume over others of the same
        description. Neither will such distinction be looked for
        but in a scientific journal. The arrangement is clear and
        satisfactory; the manner plain and illustrative; and the
        matter in accordance with the science of the present day;
        though in a few cases the nomenclature is somewhat
        overloaded with hard names, and presumes more previous
        acquaintance with the subject than is consistent. We
        subjoin a few extracts of popular interest.]</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>Caloric, or the matter of Heat.</i></p>

    <p>Heat is admitted by the philosophers of the present day to
    be the principle concerned in repulsion; and heat and cold are
    known to produce expansion and contraction in all bodies. Heat
    is, therefore, the antagonist of cohesion. Chemists have
    thought it necessary to make a distinction between the senses
    in which the word heat may be taken. In its usual acceptation,
    it merely means the effect excited on the organs of sensation
    by a hot body. But as this must be produced by a power in the
    hot body independent of sensation, that power is what chemists
    understand by the word <i>heat</i>: and to distinguish between
    the effect and its cause, the term <i>caloric</i> has been
    substituted. The introduction of this term appears altogether
    unnecessary, when the sense in which the word <i>heat</i>
    should be understood is explained. Caloric means the
    <i>cause</i> of the <i>sensation</i> heat: and there seems no
    reason to fear that the perception of heat by the organs of
    sensation can ever be misunderstood to be the agent in chemical
    phenomena.</p>

    <p><i>Omniscience displayed in the constitution of the
    Atmosphere.</i></p>

    <p>In the constitution of the atmosphere we have ample scope to
    admire the design and execution of a structure calculated, with
    such wondrous precision, to fulfil its purposes. Were the
    atmosphere to consist wholly of oxygen; and the different kinds
    of objects which compose, and are found upon, the globe, to
    remain what they are; the world would run through its stages of
    decay, renovation, and final destruction, in a rapid cycle.
    Combustion, once excited, would proceed with ungovernable
    violence; the globe, during its short existence, would be in a
    continual conflagration, until its ashes would be its only
    remains: animals would live with hundred-fold intensity, and
    terminate their mortal career in a few hours. On the other
    hand, were the atmosphere wholly composed of azote, life could
    never have existed, whether animal or vegetable, and the
    objects of the Creator in forming this world would not be
    fulfilled. But the atmosphere is a wholesome mixture of these
    two formidable elements, each neutralizing the other's baneful
    influence. The life of animals quietly runs through its
    allotted space; and the current of nature flows within
    prescribed limits, manageably and moderately.</p>

    <p><i>Tartaric Acid.</i></p>

    <p>Every one knows, that when a large quantity of the juice of
    grapes is left to spontaneous fermentation, the result is wine.
    When wine has been kept some time to depurate in wooden
    vessels, it deposits, on the side of the vessel, a hard crust
    of dark coloured matter, the taste of which is sour. This
    matter is impure; but, when purified by various
    crystallizations, it becomes perfectly white and crystalline;
    and then it is known in commerce by the name of <i>cream of
    tartar</i>. The etymology of the singular name, tartar, is
    uncertain: it is derived from <i>t&aacute;rtaros</i>, as
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page207"
       id="page207"></a>[pg 207]</span> some say, because it
       occasions pains equal to those endured in the infernal
       regions; and, as others say, merely because this substance
       deposits itself in the inferior parts of the cask. Tartaric
       acid may be obtained from cream of tartar by a process
       analogous to that given for obtaining citric acid. It has an
       exceedingly acid taste: it dissolves readily in water, and
       is soluble in alcohol. Its crystals are of a very irregular
       shape. In 100 parts, by weight, there are 12 of water; the
       remaining 88 parts are the pure anhydrous acid, composed of
       32-39 parts of carbon, 52-97 of oxygen, and 2-64 of
       hydrogen. This acid exists abundantly in other fruits, but
       especially in the tamarind; in the grape it exists along
       with citric, malic, and an acid called <i>vinic</i>, which
       resembles tartaric acid in many respects, but differs from
       it in others, and concerning the nature of which almost
       nothing is known: these four constitute the agreeable
       tartness of the juice of that fruit.</p>

    <p><i>Oxalic Acid</i>.</p>

    <p>The plant called sorrel is valued for its acidulous taste.
    This acidity is owing to the presence of a peculiar acid, which
    may be separated from the juice, and from the potash with which
    it is combined, by a process analagous to that described for
    the preparation of citric acid. It has obtained the name of
    <i>oxalic acid</i>, from the generic name of the plant,
    <i>oxalis acetosella</i>. This acid forms readily into regular
    crystals, of which one half the weight is water, the other half
    being pure acid. It is a remarkable circumstance in its
    constitution, that it contains no hydrogen, and that it
    consists merely of carbon and oxygen&mdash;there being twice as
    much oxygen as there is carbon. So that it differs from
    carbonic acid merely in the relative quantities of its
    ingredients. Oxalic acid can be prepared by an artificial
    process, with great ease, from sugar, and six times its weight
    of nitric acid,&mdash;the former affording the carbon necessary
    to its formation, and the latter the oxygen. It is only
    necessary to heat the nitric acid on the sugar; the sugar
    dissolves, and there is a violent effervescence, which must be
    moderated by immersion in cold water: when the mixture cools,
    crystals of oxalic acid form in abundance, which may be
    purified by a second crystallization.</p>

    <p>Oxalic acid is an active poison; many persons have fallen
    victims to its virulence, by having swallowed it in mistake for
    Epsom salt, which it resembles in appearance. In all
    probability, this would not prove to be the only vegetable acid
    capable of acting as a poison. Chalk finely powdered, and
    diffused in water, is the proper antidote to the poison of
    oxalic acid.</p>

    <p><i>The Plain Truth.</i>&mdash;Sir John Trevor, cousin to
    Lord Chancellor Jefferies, was an able man, but as corrupt as
    he was able. He was twice Speaker of the House of Commons, and
    officially had the mortification to put the question to the
    house, "whether himself ought to be expelled for bribery." The
    answer was "Yes."</p>

    <p><i>Freaks of Royalty.</i>&mdash;James I. in a capricious
    mood, threatened the Lord Mayor with removing the seat of
    royalty, the meetings of parliament, &amp;c. from the capital.
    "Your Majesty at least," replied the Mayor, "will be graciously
    pleased to leave us the River Thames."</p>

    <p><i>The Original Strand.</i>&mdash;In the reign of Edward
    III. the Strand was an open highway. A solitary house
    occasionally occurred; but in 1353, the ruggedness of the
    highway was such, that Edward appointed a tax on wool, leather,
    &amp;c. for its improvement.</p>

    <p>On the laying the first stone of the church of St. Martin's
    in the Fields, the king (George I.) gave one hundred guineas to
    be distributed among the workmen.</p>

    <p><i>A swampy Kingdom.</i>&mdash;In the reign of Charles II.
    at the east end of St. James's Park, there was a swampy retreat
    for the ducks, thence denominated Duck Island, which, by
    Charles was erected into a government, and a salary annexed to
    the office, in favour of the celebrated French writer, M. de
    St. Evremond, who was the first and last governor.</p>

    <p>The horse rode by the Champion in the coronation of George
    the Third was the same that bore George the Second at the
    memorable battle of Dettingen.</p>

    <p><i>Political Criticism.</i>&mdash;The following proof of
    political prejudice may not be known:&mdash;"John Milton was
    one whose natural parts might deservedly give him a place
    amongst the principal of our English poets, having written two
    heroic poems and a tragedy, viz:&mdash;Paradise Lost, Paradise
    Regained, and Samson Agonistes; <i>but his fame is gone out
    like a candle in a snuff</i>; and his memory will always stink,
    which might have ever lived in honourable repute, had he not
    been a notorious traitor, and most impiously and villanously
    belied that blessed martyr, King Charles I."&mdash;<i>Lives of
    the most famous English Poets, &amp;c. 1687, by Wm.
    Winstanley.</i></p>

    <p><i>A Pastor.</i>&mdash;The Rev. Andrew Marvell, A.M. father
    of the patriot, was born at Mildred, in Cambridgeshire, in
    1586. He was a student of Emanuel College in that University,
    where he took his degree of Master of Arts in 1608. Afterwards
    he was elected <span class="pagenum"><a name="page208"
       id="page208"></a>[pg 208]</span> master of the grammar
       school at Hull, and in 1624, lecturer of Trinity Church in
       that town. "He was a most excellent preacher," says Fuller,
       "who, like a good husband, never broached what he had
       new-brewed, but preached what he had studied some competent
       time before: insomuch that he was wont to say that he would
       cross the common proverb, which called 'Saturday the working
       day, and Monday the holiday, of preachers.'"</p>

            <p>"<i>Flecnoe</i>, thy characters are so full of

            <p>Each line's a <i>volume</i>, and who reads would
            swear</p>

            <p><i>Whole libraries</i> were in each character.</p>

            <p>Nor arrows in a quiver stuck, nor yet</p>

            <p>Lights in the starry skies are thicker set,</p>

            <p>Nor quills upon the armed porcupine,</p>

    <h4>SIR WALTER SCOTT.</h4>

    <p>The long-expected death of this good and great man took
    place at Abbotsford on Friday, September 21. Our seventh volume
    contains a Portrait and Memoir of his life to the year 1826;
    and it is our intention to prepare for our ensuing number, a
    brief memoir continued to his last days, with a wood-cut
    portrait from the latest painting. About twelve months since,
    Sir Walter wrote, with almost prophetic pen, the following
    passage in the introduction to his last published work: "The
    gentle reader is acquainted, that these are, in all
    probability, the last tales which it will be the lot of the
    author to submit to the public." The sequel has not been so far
    realized, though the accordance of the closing line with the
    last hours of the deceased bears a consoling balm: "He is now
    on the eve of visiting foreign parts; a ship of war is
    commissioned by its royal master to carry the Author of
    Waverley to climates in which he may possibly obtain such a
    restoration of health as may serve him to spin his thread to an
    end in his own country."</p>

    <p><i>Eating Goose on Michaelmas Day</i>.&mdash;Although this
    custom can be traced through upwards of three centuries, its
    origin has not been decided by antiquaries. The commonly
    received belief is that a goose forming part of the royal
    dinner when the news was brought to Queen Elizabeth of the
    defeat of the Spanish Armada, her chivalrous majesty commanded
    that the dish (a goose) then before her, might be served up on
    every 29th of September, to commemorate the above glorious
    event. Mr. Douce, the learned antiquarian illustrator, saw the
    above reason "somewhere" (such is his expression); but Mr.
    Brand thinks this rather to be a stronger proof that the custom
    prevailed at court in Queen Elizabeth's time. Its origin,
    however, is referable to the previous century: since, bringing
    a goose "fit for the lord's dinner," on this day appears to
    have been customary even in the time of Edward IV.; and, that
    it was common before the Armada victory, is shown the following
    passage in Gascoigne, who died in 1577, or eleven years before
    the above event:&mdash;</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"And when the tenauntes come to pay their quarter's
            rent,</p>

            <p>They bring some fowle at Midsummer, a dish of fish
            at Lent;</p>

            <p>At Christmasse a capon, <i>at Michaelmas a
            goose</i>,</p>

            <p>And somewhat else at New Yere's-tide, <i>for feare
            their leave flies</i></p>

            <p class="i2">loose."</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>The reason given by Blount, in his <i>Tenures</i>, is
    considered far from satisfactory. Beckwith, his editor, says,
    "Probably no other reason can be given for this custom, but
    that Michaelmas Day was a great festival, and geese at that
    time were most plentiful." The origin of the saying that "if
    you eat goose on Michaelmas Day, you will never want money all
    the year round," is explained, in the <i>British Apollo</i>, as
    follows:&mdash;</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>The custom came up from the tenants presenting</p>

            <p>Their landlords with geese to incline their
            relenting</p>

            <p>On following payments.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>Again:&mdash;</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>For doubtless 'twas at first design'd</p>

            <p>To make the people seasons mind,</p>

            <p>That so they might apply their care</p>

            <p>To all those things which needful were;</p>

            <p>And by a good industrious hand,</p>

            <p>Know when and how t' improve their land.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>Ellis, in his notes to Brand, says, "the practice of eating
    goose on Michaelmas Day does not appear to prevail in any part
    of France. Upon St. Martin's Day, they eat turkey at Paris.
    They likewise eat geese upon St. Martin's Day, Twelfth Day, and
    Shrove Tuesday, at Paris." In Denmark, where the harvest is
    later than here, every family has a roasted goose for supper on
    St. Martin's Eve. PHILO.</p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year. For example:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
